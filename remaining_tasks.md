-- in budget i can add monthly options as they might need to change the budget ratio every month, if do not want to change we are not forcing we are setting the budget for each month based on the last month budget was set.
--  can you anlayse and tell me in the loan option i think there is improvement needed as in loan option we can do this add option so that how often we are paying it and also on the which date to deduct that amount of the money each month from that account as without this it will make the look of the overall account too bad ?? what are your thoughts
