<!-- -- in budget i can add monthly options as they might need to change the budget ratio every month, if do not want to change we are not forcing we are setting the budget for each month based on the last month budget was set.
--  can you anlayse and tell me in the loan option i think there is improvement needed as in loan option we can do this add option so that how often we are paying it and also on the which date to deduct that amount of the money each month from that account as without this it will make the look of the overall account too bad ?? what are your thoughts

--  can you anlayse and tell me in the loan option i think there is improvement needed as in loan option we can do this add option so that how often we are paying it and also on the which date to deduct that amount of the money each month from that account as without this it will make the look of the overall account too bad ?? what are your thoughts and also i think it is more focused on the loan type based on  the banking system but we are making for regular users and they might have lent money to family friends and for this they might take interest and also they might not take interest or do not have specific return date also right so now give me the solution. -->

<!-- -- I have to make the folder sturcture more robust First of all. -- Completed -->
-- I am seeing the data i added after too much time as i wanted this when i click the save button and return to screen it must show me the data without any issue or making me fill like i am waiting means instant data showing.

-- Switching between different pages is laging too much i have to make it smoother and also make the whole application more smoother and faster.
    <!-- -- So first of all i will make reusable component for those which are being used in multiple screen files so to make the code size less and also make core robust but do it only for the functionality as for the design i will do it later when i think minimal product is ready ok. -- Some reusable componenets created but i have to recheck deeply that it is being used correctly and not like just made this components but we are not using it and writing code instead. -->
    <!-- -- Only have to make new reusable component which are being used in multiple files only. -->
-- I am planning to totally redesign the calculater page, also add feature like real calculator in my samsung mobile as when i do calcluation i can see all the numbers i have added like this 12+23+238+329-265 and once i enter any number after the operator i am seeing the total also below along with the above numbers i mentioned before, but currently it is not providing feature like this it is only handling two numbers at a time.

<!-- -- Now I have to check are all the functionalities currently in the application are working correctly or not like i have added the module but have forgot to add the functionality inside of it. ✅ checked but the thing is that i have to check that all the implemented features are working as they should have.-->


------------------------------------------------------
<!-- -- Add App logo. -- Completed -->
<!-- -- In Report page add + button so that user can add expense and icome from there also and use the same button as the dashboard and after update of the transaction we have to move user to the dashboard so he or she can see it easily. -- ✅ IMPLEMENTED but still have to make it smoother to use.-->
<!-- -- I have to improve the ui of the filtering option Make it smaller as all the componentes inside are needed but i can make the ui small.
    -- After selecting the filter option from here do not close the selcetion card ok.  -- ✅ IMPLEMENTED -->
<!-- -- I have to decide how account selection will work as some account types and categories are mostly used and for this reason i can it as the by deafualt option or something like this. 
    -- User will be able add expense from account which might now have any money left as sometimes user might have forgot to add money in app. so negative balance can be allowed.
    -- But we have to warn the uer about it if account in negative by making account red or other options also which are good. ✅ IMPLEMENTED Testing is remaining.-->

<!-- -- In budget page make it possible to select the month if want to see budget criteria of past.✅ IMPLEMENTED but some more improvements like design make it just like the dashboard we are showing the selection option and remove that calender icon beside the month text, not opening the year option directly have to do it. and also have to remove the current month option. -->

<!-- -- In creation of categories give more options for the icons.
-- Same in the accounts creation and also there i have to add the option so that user can be able to create the account type which he wanted to create(custom account type).
    -- I can also add option to add the limit in the account also. -- ✅ IMPLEMENTED Testing is remaining. -- 1 -->

<!-- -- Selection of time is too complecated for 24 hour type as i do not know about the 12 hour clock. try to make it simple.
    -- I think giving user option like entering time by opening the number only keypad for ease of use, I have to try this.
    -- Do not keep the arrow always selected on the Add Notes as it is fustrating me whenever i am trying to do any other task it redirect me to the add notes component. -- ✅ IMPLEMENTED Testing is remaining.-- 2 -->
    
------------------- Loan Screen
-- Have to improve the loan Screen and make it so that i can use it mainly for the lending and borrowing information and also give it capability to properly handle the loan functionality.
    -- I have to make the first page of when entering the details about the total money lent or borrowed just like the income and expense as i think this might be better option or i can do this first let user select he is entering what loan or just normal lent as for normal lent i can do this make it just like the splitwise or the google pay option. 
    -- And when selected the loan option i will show details accordings to that but still i have to make that page much more cleaner and user friendly.
    -- Also give filtering like the dashboard page as current page is diving in two parts which i do not like.
    -- there is option money lent and money borrowed option in the header for filtering purpose which i want to remove as i can add other filter option just like the dashboard so that but with lent and borrow option and i can do work with single screen.
--------------------

-- Add more report analyse options like by date or range of date also.
    -- In category brakedown show pie chart side by side not in above and below to save the space and it will be easy to compare it. -- 3 --------------------------

<!-- -- If i have not set the budget for some categories why i am seeing that over the budget and also i can give option to check that overall budget limit is not exceeded if i do not want to set budget for each and every field. 
    -- Because the thing is that some time user might add budget if they wanted to keep expense in budget they will add the budget for that category. ✅ IMPLEMENTED Testing is remaining -- 4 -->

<!-- -- In dark mode in the budget,reports, account screen and many more other places it is showing me the different card but why we are making the different card as for the dark theme we only have to change color to the dark to make the dark theme no need to cahnge the design of the card or anything except the color and also dashboard page i am seeing the cards differently. -- 5  ✅ IMPLEMENTED Testing is remaining  -->

<!-- -- In accounts types showing of the account categories i can improve the ui and also there is only fix amount of account types and debit card missing so i can give either option to create new one if user want or add debit card statistically. -- ✅ IMPLEMENTED Testing is remaining. -- 1.2 -->

<!-- -- On click of the dark and light theme button make it choose the theme between the dark,light and system deafualt and make the theme as light theme as the defualt one. 
    -- during this process make the left side icon change to between this three types icons.
    -- This is too make it easy to understood that in which theme we are currently in.
    -- No need to enter the into seperate page and this will remove unnecessary code. -- Do it in the future. -->
<!-- -- Remove the Income and Expense options from the hambergur menu on the left side.. ✅ IMPLEMENTED -->
<!-- -- Remove the Transfer option showing in filter options.
    -- Now show all the remaining options in the center to make it look good.  -- Completed. -->
-- Make load on single frame reduce as currently it is putting too much load on the single screen or file of the code i do not know exactly but i am getting error something like this.

<!-- -- Calander is not allowing to select date option before the 2020 so you have to make this option runable so that user can add or see any range data as they wanted to add some old data also or wnated to make the future expense written early. ✅ IMPLEMENTED Testing is remaining.  -->
-- Give options also like this in expense or income which might be repetable each month or daily or weakly as they wanted to add they can add it so that for that perticular transaction user do not have to enter it every time.
    -- I will think how it should work in the future.

-- Give option so that user can delete the existing category if they want and also if user delete the category and we have to give him option to do this, ask user that how to add the category to the transactions which we are deleting as we also have to remove it from the transactions user has added.
    -- If we delete all the things which are related to that category it will delte the user has added the data.
    -- Think about it more carefully as this is very sensitive work.

-- Do i have to open app with the current month or day,week,year when restarting the app or have to keep the day,month or year user was seeing last.
